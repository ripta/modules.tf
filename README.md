# modules.tf

**A collection of [Terraform Modules](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html).** Modules can be imported by pointing to the source URL on github:

```terraform
module "vpc" {
  source = "github.com/ripta/modules.tf//aws/vpc/natted"
}
```

**The double-slash in the source URL is required;** it acts as a separator of the module location inside the repository. Check out the `inputs.tf` and `outputs.tf` inside each module for documentation on the variables imported into and exported from the module. These modules are available:

* AWS VPC:
  * `aws/vpc/public-only`: single-AZ setup based on [Scenario 1](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario1.html) from the VPC User Guide, which consists of one *public subnet* and one Internet Gateway.
  * `aws/vpc/natted`: single-AZ VPC setup based on [Scenario 2](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Scenario2.html) from the VPC User Guide, which consists of two subnets (public and private subnet), one Internet Gateway, one ingress Bastion instance, one egress NAT instance, 2 security groups in the public subnet (NAT and Bastion), and routes.
* AWS EC2 Bootstrapping:
  * `aws/ec2/saltstack.tpl`: templates to bootstrap saltstack as the provisioner.
